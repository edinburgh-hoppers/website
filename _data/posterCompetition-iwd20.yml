         This is an amazing opportunity to present your favourite project, may it be academic or
         personal, and show off what you have achieved. The posters can be ongoing work as well. It
         does not have to be a complete work and can also include group work. This is a great way to
         show the work you are most proud of in a safe environment to your peers, future employers and
         collaborators and get their interest. See it a bit like an offline portfolio."
