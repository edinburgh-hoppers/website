  answer1: I want to be part of a community that encourages women to do Computer Science and that is run by women themselves because I think these sort of communities are important for bridging the equality gap in the workplace.
  answer2: I have been part of many teams that have lead very successful fundraising events so I have lots of experience with meetings, handling unpredicted problems and getting things done. For instance, I loved KPOP so much that I helped organise and setup the only KPOP concert in my country and raised over £700! I am just as passionate about promoting women in technology so I intend to put the same amount of work and enthusiasm into this role.
  answer3: I am very easy to talk to so members could feel comfortable asking me questions about the society and its events, or anything CS related. I come from an international background so I feel I would be able to connect with international students as well, I think this is important because I understand how daunting it can be to approach a new society.

  answer1:  I’ve attended an all-girls’ middle school and high school so I feel a great affinity with other women. However in my high school, only 25% of the student body studied STEM, and there was an even smaller percentage of those who wanted to study mathematics or computer science. So I am very excited to meet more women that share my interests, and to be able to actively contribute to this community. Additionally, I had volunteered at a Hoppers event last year and I had a great time. I made a few good acquaintances, but what stood out to me was that the event run smoothly. Things seemed to be going as planned, and there was almost no friction between volunteers. This leads me to believe that taking on responsibility in Hoppers will be a positive experience where there is good cooperation and difficulties are overcome as a team.
  answer2:  During my high school years, I founded a small student society that sold water at tourist spots to raise money for people with HIV. Because it was very small, I had to take care of all the administrative tasks, including the budgeting. I wrote a pitch for my high school to receive some funding, and I developed a plan on how that money would be spent.
  answer3:  By being present. To be completely honest, I am not too skilled in using social media, and I can’t say I am a social butterfly. But I can promise to consistently participate in events, and hopefully that can encourage others to do so too.

  answer1: I am really inspired by the Hoppers' goal of providing a community for gender minorities in STEM. I have previously participated in Hoppers events and have had the opportunity to have conversations with amazing women in the industry. These events have been both inspiring and eye opening. I want to be a part of such a community where we are able to talk about often overlooked struggles of gender minorities and are able to engage with incredible women who have some of the most interesting stories to share. But most of all I want our friends at the university and beyond to understand that they too can have an impact, for them to find a supportive community and representation. This is why I want to be a part of Hoppers.
  answer2: I was the Head Girl at my school, an experience that has made me responsible and has taught me how to balance my duties with my academic workload. As a Head Girl I have been responsible for representing my school, organising school festivals, cultural programmes, charity functions etc. I have also hosted several events. I was also in charge of leading the student council and communicating the students' needs to the authorities and having them understood and met. It helped me appreciate teamwork and establish methods of clear communication. <br>Me and my team also won the Strategic Planning poster presentation for our university business course. This experience taught me how to work with different  people with different levels of expertise and different perspectives and how to coordinate well enough to achieve our goals.
  answer3: I would like to look into further advertising of our events through social media and emails. I would also like to get an idea of what it is that students might want to talk about or events they might be interested in through poles or other methods. I would also like to include general student consensus on our events to show the impact of these talks on them. I would love to reach out to more and more academics, journalists and industry professionals. Although it has been all virtual this year, I do want to help Hoppers reach an even bigger audience for all the incredible events it has.

  answer1: I am really interested in getting involved in Hoppers as it is such a wonderful society. Having a supportive and inclusive environment for gender minorities in computer science makes a huge difference to students. This was something I never had growing up attending all girls schools that did not encourage us to pursue computer science. I would love to help support other students, grow this community and reinforce the inclusive and welcoming spirit of Hoppers. I am also keen to meet more technology and computer science enthusiasts and to learn new things.
  answer2: I have very good leadership skills. I have helped coach the U10 team in my inline hockey club and have helped organise girls’ inline hockey events at my club. This has allowed me to improve my patience and my organisation and leadership skills. I also acted as a mentor for first year students at my secondary school, giving them advice and supporting them through the transition between primary school and secondary school. I have good teamwork and communication skills from being involved in technology related group projects which have involved public speaking, contacting people and regularly keeping track of the progress of the projects and the goals we wanted to achieve.
  answer3: I would be interested in looking into the possibility of setting up a scheme where younger students are paired with older students who could offer support, advice and mentorship. This would help younger students better adapt to university life and studying computer science and make the most of their degrees, whilst older students could greatly improve their leadership, mentoring and communication skills. I believe this would strengthen the Hoppers community and get members involved, particularly during the pandemic where in person events are not possible and it is not easy to make personal connections with people.
