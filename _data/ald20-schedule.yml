          speaker-info: 
            - info : <b>Olivia Gambelin </b>is an AI Ethicist who works to bring ethical analysis into tech development to create human-centric innovation. She believes there is strength in human values that, when applied to artificial intelligence, lead to robust technological solutions we can trust. Olivia holds an MSc in Philosophy from the University of Edinburgh, concentration in AI Ethics with special focus on probability and moral responsibility in autonomous cars, as well as a BA in Philosophy and Entrepreneurship from Baylor University. Currently, Olivia works as the Founder of <a href = 'https://ethicalintelligence.co/' target = '_blank'>Ethical Intelligence</a> where she leads a remote team of over thirty experts in the Tech Ethics field.

            - info : <b>Prof. Alex Lascarides </b>studied Mathematics at Durham, graduating in 1984. While doing her maths degree, she also took options in philosophy and logic, and found that she enjoyed engaging in work that combines insights from the sciences and humanties. This developed into an interest in Cognitive Science, and she came to Edinburgh to do her Masters and PhD because of its reputation in inter-disciplinary research. She found the research environment in Edinburgh so stimulating and the city itself so attractive that she has stayed in Edinburgh ever since---other than one year spent at Stanford as a visiting assistant professor---first as a postdoctoral fellow and then as a lecturer, reader and professor. <br><br> Prof. Lascarides' research interests are in modelling discourse and dialogue, including face to face dialogues where people gesture as well as speak, and non-cooperative dialogues where people may be deceptive and unhelpful in other ways.
            - info : <b>Lucy Havens</b> is a PhD student at the University of Edinburgh, researching how technology can support the large-scale identification and classification of bias in archival descriptions. Previously, she worked at Royal Bank of Scotland doing design and development work for an internal data portal, and at West Monroe Partners as a business and technology consultant specializing in customer experience. She has a B.S in Information Systems from Carnegie Mellon University and a AMSc in Design Informatics from the University of Edinburgh.
