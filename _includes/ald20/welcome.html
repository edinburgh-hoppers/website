	<p>Hello and welcome, we are keen to celebrate our event with you all!</p>
	<p>The event will feature technical workshops on web development ranging from programming to design as well as a variety of talks and discussions outside this that will help you grow your personal skills and allow you to meet inspiring individuals of the tech scene. See our schedule below for more information.</p>
	<p>For the first time in Hoppers’ history we will hold a 2-day event to accommodate all the great speakers we invited for you! Everything will be online, but don’t worry, there is still merch: we have prepared a great virtual Hoppers planner for you!</p>
