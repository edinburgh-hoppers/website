	<p>Hello and welcome, we are keen to celebrate our event with you all!</p>
	<p>The focus of the event will be web application, but for those of you interested in other areas we offer a lot of other amazing non-webapp related sessions that will help you grow your personal skills and allow you to meet inspiring individuals of the tech scene. See our schedule below for more information.</p>
	<p>For the first time in Hoppers’ history we will hold a 2-day event to accommodate all the great speakers we invited for you! Everything will be online, but don’t worry, there is still merch: we have prepared a great virtual Hoppers planner for you!</p>
	<p>Look around our webpage to find more information and we are looking forward to seeing you on the 12th and 13th of October!</p>
	<p>Given the current situation, we've had the fantastic opportunity to invite speakers and participants from around the world. </p>
