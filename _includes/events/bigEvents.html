In the first semester Hoppers host a day full of events in honor of Ada Lovelace and in the second semester we
celebrate the International Women's Day. Big Events are days full of workshops, talks, and refreshments.<br>
To get an impression of  how past events looked like, see our <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/ald20">Ada Lovelace Day 2020</a> website!
