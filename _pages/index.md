As the official society for women in informatics at the University of Edinburgh our goal is to cultivate an open community with the aim to provide a supportive and inclusive society where people are comfortable and build both technical and networking skills to thrive in the tech environment.

In order to do so, we organize events where we cooperate with large and small companies  to provide our members with the best opportunities and contacts to build a career. Our focus is to empower all women and non-binaries in technology.
