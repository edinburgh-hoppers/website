            The Edinburgh Hoppers is proud to present a small scholarship scheme for our members. With the scholarship, we aim to provide support for a variety of needs such as:
        </p>
        <ol class="list">
            <li><b>Professional and personal development</b>: paying examination fees, enrollment fees for an online course, public speaking lessons, life skills coaching, etc.</li>
            <li><b>Living Costs</b>: assistance for paying rent and utility bills, which can be tough in the pandemic.</li>
            <li><b>Travelling</b>: this would involve requiring support for taking a Covid-19 test for essential travel (we will not provide support for any non-essential travel, as per travel regulations).</li>
        </ol>
        <p>You do not necessarily need to fall into these categories to apply for a scholarship. However, you will be given the opportunity to elaborate on your situation in the application.  The maximum amount we can potentially donate to one applicant is Â£200.</p>
