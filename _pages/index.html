<div class="mx-auto d-block" style="max-width: 800px;">
  <p>As the official society for Gender Minorities in Informatics at the University of Edinburgh our goal is to
  cultivate an open community with the aim to provide a supportive and inclusive society
  where people are comfortable and build both technical and networking skills to thrive in the tech environment.</p>

  <p>In order to do so, we organize events where we cooperate with large and small companies  to provide our
  members with the best opportunities and contacts to build a career. Our focus is to empower all women,
  non-binaries and transgender in technology.</p>
