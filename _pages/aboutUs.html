<div class="aboutUsVoices mb-3">
  <p>As the official society for Gender Minorities in Informatics at the University of Edinburgh our goal is to cultivate an open community with
  the aim to provide a supportive and inclusive space for people to build both technical and networking skills. With approximately 600 members,
  ranging from first year to PhD students, we are one of the largest communities in the School of Informatics. Hoppers has been active for
  almost 15 years. The society has been created by a group of female teaching staff as part of the School in order to empower the women working
  or studying in the field.</p>

  <p>We partner with top tier companies and start-ups, such as Google, Amazon and Modulr, to provide our members with the best learning
  opportunities and networks to build a future career. Because Informatics is a broad subject with potential both in research and industry, we
  are trying to diversify our events as much as possible. In order to do so, we organize at least two technical talks or workshops each month -
  some of the past ones include interview bootcamps, workshops on building a personal website or workshops about blockchain. Our two biggest
  events of the year are Ada Lovelace Day hosted in October, and the International Womens Day hosted in March. This year the IWD event will be
  even bigger and more special - our Society is celebrating its 15th anniversary and we have prepared a day full of interesting talks, workshops
  and fun challenges.</p>

  <p>To facilitate building a community, we also make sure to organize social events. We start off each academic year with a Welcome Lunch for our
  new and current members to put the emphasis on the fact that everyone is welcomed in our community and to give new students the opportunity to
  meet new friends and seek advice right from the beginning of their university journey. We also offer a range of different activities for our
  members throughout the year, such as bowling, ice skating or mini golf.</p>

  <p>The School of Informatics has offered amazing support to promote more tech opportunities to our members and to help them thrive. Hopefully,
  we will be able to get more and more women interested in Tech through our work.</p>
